# game_usingcli

This is a small game to learn how to use the command line.
To start the game, open a command line and type:
```
git clone https://github.com/jcolomb/game_usingcli.git
cd game_usingcli
```

(you need git to be installed)

now type `start.txt` on windows

on mac/linus type `cat start2.txt`

this was a place to think, but https://gitlab.com/slackermedia/bashcrawl already exists... Would be nice to port it for windows comand line...
