Hello unix users, welcome to the terminal maze!


By using cat you wrote the content of this file in the terminal, so you can read it directly there !

You will first learn to move around, the command for this is called "cd"
To move forward, you can tell what door to open, for instance write "cd enter" to enter the maze, if you dare!

You can always go backward by using "cd ../"

Once you are in the maze, type `ls` to look around.
